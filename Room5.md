### Tree / Summer Room
- Came from Autumn/Summer Glow, Rams Horn columns on the ground
- Dry heat
- Caveman drawings with black charcoal like walls
	- All animals Horned drawings even those that would normally have none (even birds and squirrels)
	- After blowing the horn, I see parrots sprouting from the ground and a hand trying to harvest the crops, with talons
- A center stone tree
	- The heavy lines the represent the bark, moss carved on to a specific side towards the Unicorn Door
- Center archways, they looks reused to create horn symbols
- Doors
	- Cones like a bull
	- Antler Door
	- Unicorn Door (glows yellow after blowing for Fall)
- Knife sharpening
- We go through [Fall/Unicorn Doorway](Room6)
