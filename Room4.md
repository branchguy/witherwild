### Spring Room
- Room4 -->
	- Non horned bird
	- Small anti chamber
	- 3 pathways with different markings
	- carved out or dug up, much more natural
	- what once was a courtyard or garden, is now overrun with bramble + corruption
	- Inscription with antlers
		- "He knows all turns of these halls Corrin, chosen guide of the horn-bearers. He brings the faithful safely through stone and shadow."
		- Deer antlers
	- The bramble is coming from the floor and ceiling
	- everything leads here
	- Choices
		- Bull horns
		- Ram horns
		- Ram horns
		- Gazelle door (just came from)
	- After blowing the horn a green glow, bolt beacon is cast and pops some pollen pods revealing up a dried up stone fountain with a broken spout in the shape of a bird. At the center of the fountain is a bronze plaque that reads
		- **"Spring"**
		- "Where all journeys were once permitted to begin."
	- Casts Drown Willow, and the fountain spout shows a green glow, further down the pathway.
	- Cathedral doors, one is broken and learning off its hinge, and the other is shattered and rotting leaving a stench
	- Inside is a room with a dome, a green glowing boulder statue of a cave, nests and eggs and stone carved beasts, flaked off paintings on the roof, [rotting flesh smell as the pollen falls from the ceiling](Witherwild), stone creatures drinking water. On each quarter of the dome there more church archways, each with their own unique shape, and are unconventional and altered poorly to represent [horns](Hornucopia.md), bastardized to look like [horns](Hornucopia)
		- All the animals have horns placed on made of wood, but sculpted by stone bear cubs, eggs nests, snakes, creatures leaving the shelter, [victimized by the rotting purple flowers and vines](Witherwild)
		- Humid
	- Choose [Summer/Autumn Door](Room5)
