### Snow Cliff face (Boss Room)
- Temperature drops 10 degrees
- Another circular chamber
- Snow/limestone is packed against the top
- Undeniable smell of corruptions, spores, plant growth very concentrated #witherwild
- In the center is a statue almost completely covered with brambles and growth, in the center of a fountain where the water is a dull dark purple
- Awful Scraping, sword strikes against the walls ruining it with a blade like tally marks in a jail cell, until a thump like a knock on a door
- A massive creature with it's unicorn horn scraping the side of the wall, antlers off it's shoulder pads / neck, blackish grass mane on it's back full of corruption and spores pouring out comes out, deep yellow eyes with two smaller large creatures

- "Then you will join our domain as well"
- "You will die by my hands" --> there's a serrated blade on his horn with spores resonating
