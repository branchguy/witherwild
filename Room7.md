### Snow Cliff face (Boss Room)
- Temperature drops 10 degrees
- Another circular chamber
- Snow/limestone is packed against the top
- Undeniable smell of corruptions, spores, plant growth very concentrated #witherwild
- In the center is a statue almost completely covered with brambles and growth, in the center of a fountain where the water is a dull dark purple
- Awful Scraping, sword strikes against the walls ruining it with a blade like tally marks in a jail cell, until a thump like a knock on a door
- A massive creature with it's unicorn horn scraping the side of the wall, antlers off it's shoulder pads / neck, blackish grass mane on it's back full of corruption and spores pouring out comes out, deep yellow eyes with two smaller large creatures
- [[Corrin, the Unicorn]]:  "I am the warden of Roccin, the wandering horn....I once guided people down the path, I once guided down people who worshipped the  (what do you want)"
- "They may come if they wish to join my domain, this place is no longer roccins it is mine, it is Corin's. I have found a greater purpose than the leader of the herd has offered me. I am stronger than before, I do not with to serve as an umpire to someone else"
- "Then you will join our domain as well"
- "You will die by my hands" --> there's a serrated blade on his horn with spores resonating 



**Post Boss Battle**
- We entered evening, it's early morning, and we expect Vor to enter soon
- There's healing solvent leaves near the fountain
- "Water is the source of all life right? How is this place supposed to heal without water" 
- [[Drowned Willow]] is dipped into the withered purple fountain, and it begins to **cleanse** the fountain turning it to holy water, but and this fixes the statue and cleans / fixes revealing a bird **owl** statue with fake wooden antlers

- After [[Ophelia]] pours water on planted herb begins to grow unnaturally from holy water from the fountain, the green roots, a small stag beetle appears from the sprout and talks to the party

- "Hello there"
	- It smells like pine trees
- "I'm not the wandering the horn, I'm new, I think I'm Korrrin"
- "The fountain shouldn't be doing anything, my job is to guide the horn bearers to the  [[Cornuvaris]]"
- "Why is the statue glowing? The **old powers of the labyrinth** shouldn't be working here but they are"


We follow Korrin through the [glowing archway](Room8)
