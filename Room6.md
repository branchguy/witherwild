### Farm Harvest / Fall
- Sounds of Metal hitting stone
- Everything is on a few degree slope and we stand on the high point, with doors on each end
- Farm landscape with elevated doors on each side
	- Rabbits, 2 farmer humans, depicted in snow
	- Crops, carrots, tomatoes, plants
- All animals have those wooden horns
- Half of the stone floor is [taken over by brambles and spores and is overgrown with corruption](Witherwild)
- Walls have leaves falling from dying branches
- Triangular murals are more intact, room is split into fourths, with a circular mural at the top
	- A bird flying through seasons
	- Snow covering below the trees
	- Budding / Flourishing of the forest
	- Dull overcast sun in the center, where a wingspan eclipses the sun
- Made it past the brambles towards the [Winter Doorway](Room7)
